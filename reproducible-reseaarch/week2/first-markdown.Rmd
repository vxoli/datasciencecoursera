## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r activitydata}
data <- read.csv(("/home/christopher/Documents/Coursera_Data_Science/datasciencecoursera/reproducible-reseaarch/week2/activity.csv"))
```

## Including Plots

Histogram of steps per day

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(data$steps)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
